## About Project <a name="introduction"></a>
StatHelp is a utility tool that includes centeral tendency calculations, probability distributions and data visual analysis with graphs.

## Project Struture  <a name="structure"></a>
### Web
StatHelp is using React for the web. The app is connected to the node-js server using axios. 
### Android
Mobile version is made in react-native. I will be deploying the app on android playstore. There are no plans to deploy the app on iOS.
### Server
App and web are using a shared NodeJS server. The server contains algorithms for probability distributions and other calculations.

## Testing <a name="testing"></a>
I have a few tests for the node server using jest. I plan on doing more testing for the algorithms in the future.
